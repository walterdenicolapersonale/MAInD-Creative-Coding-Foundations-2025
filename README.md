# MAInD-Creative-Coding-Foundations-2025-2026
**Course name**: **Creative Coding Foundations**

**Course ID**: **ID102.01**

**Teachers**: Marco Lurati, Giovanni Profeta

**Assistants**: Luca Draisci

# Goals

***Acquire the fundamental knowledge of coding principles and terminology to be able to work in an interdisciplinary team in different design fields***

## (how)

*by individually practicing writing code following good practices and documenting it, using industry-standard development tools*

## What you will learn

- Foundational knowledge of programming concepts and coding principles applicable across various fields and applications
- Fundamentals of web languages (HTML, CSS) with a primary focus on plain JavaScript
- Skills to create interactive web interfaces with multimedia content
- How to use industry-standard development tools like Visual Studio Code and GitHub

## Description

The course aims to provide students with a broad introduction to coding, with a special emphasis on human-computer interaction.

It is based on the recent core web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and the VS Code and Github tools. It offers hands-on experience with responsive web design implementation, DOM manipulation, API usage and I/O integration via the Canvas (for example, using the microphone).

Each week, the students will learn and apply new programming principles and techniques in a one-day class that includes the following sessions: a brief individual written test covering all previous topics (which will be evaluated), a lecture on programming delivered by the lecturers, practical exercises supported by the teaching staff, and development of class assignments.

The assignments and the course are designed to build programming experience for the remainder of the master’s program, and the brief written tests allow students to personally assess their understanding and mastery of core fundamental topics.
